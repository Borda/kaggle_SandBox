This is a simple template project to Kaggle participation...

### Expected content:

- a core package with functionalities used across scripts and notebooks
- tutorial/experiment notebooks (in _notebook_ folder if needed)
- \[optional\] some functionality testing aka unittests or doctests

### What to write here:

- simple completion description + link
- shortly what task it is to solve
- list/link online sources
- link kernels/submissions
